# Open Source, Dyalog, and GSoC

## Intro

The Dyalog APL interpreter is NOT open source.
Nonetheless Dyalog has several noteworthy open source projects.
To highlight some:
| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| [TryAPL](https://github.com/Dyalog/TryAPL) | Online playground for Dyalog APL |
| [Py'n'APL](https://github.com/Dyalog/pynapl) | Dyalog APL ←→ Python interface |
| [Dyalog Jupyter kernel](https://github.com/Dyalog/dyalog-jupyter-kernel) | Jupyter kernel for Dyalog APL |
| [Ride](https://github.com/Dyalog/ride) | Cross-platform IDE for Dyalog APL |
| [Mastering Dyalog APL](https://github.com/Dyalog/MDAPL) | _De facto_ standard for learning Dyalog APL from a book |

they're also built with Dyalog projects:
| Name | Description |
|-|-|
| [Link](https://github.com/Dyalog/link) | Store APL code as text files |
| [qSE](https://github.com/Dyalog/qSE) | Dyalog APL Session initialisation |
| [Jarvis](https://github.com/Dyalog/Jarvis) | Web service framework |
| [HttpCommand](https://github.com/Dyalog/HttpCommand) | HTTP utility |
| [Conga-apl](https://github.com/Dyalog/conga-apl) | Core communication library |

Great! They're built by the community, right?

Mostly Dyalog employees. Is that representative of the community? Hopefully not.

## Call to action

How can Dylog bring new contributors into its ecosystem?

Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://g.co/gsoc)) does just that.
It's a global, online program that brings new contributors into open source software organizations.

For the first time, Dyalog will be applying to GSoC as an organization,
and Dyalog needs **your** help.
**You**, the reader, the community, users and potential users.

When you try to use Dyalog projects, ask yourself:
- What stopped you from using it? 
- When you use it, what could make your life easier?
