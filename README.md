## Finalised Ideas for GSoC 2025

### Make the TryAPL front end mobile friendly
- Project: TryAPL Front End
- Size: 175 hours
- Level: Medium
- Project URL: https://github.com/Dyalog/TryAPL

#### Description:

TryAPL is an online service that allows users to experiment with APL in a web browser without having to install any additional software. APL code entered into the system is sent over HTTP to a sandboxed environment that interprets the code and returns the formatted output to the user. Moreover, the entire state of the execution workspace, including defined functions and variables, is stored in a serialised, compressed format client side in the browser so that no server-side sessions or state need to be maintained. The system includes a JavaScript-based input method for APL symbols for both keyboard and mouse, as well as the ability to interpret and render Dyalog Jupyter notebooks.

The front-end can be used on mobile devices, but was not designed with mobile-first principles and as such has some issues when viewed on some touch-screen devices. Improvement to the TryAPL front end will make APL more accessible to users on a wider range of devices.

This project is to develop the front end of TryAPL to be mobile friendly; the interface will be accessible on touch screen devices. The input system will be refactored to an entirely managed system using JavaScript that prevents the device operating system's keyboard from popping up. There will need to be an on-screen keyboard that allows input of ASCII and APL characters. There should be some consideration for the use of interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials.

#### Expected outcomes:
The TryAPL project will have a new front end that can be deployed on https://tryapl.org.
Technologies involved: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
